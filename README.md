## Project Overview: Firefighting Drone Development

We are currently developing a firefighting drone capable of carrying a payload of 10 to 15 kg. To systematically approach this challenging project, we are building two prototypes:

1. Experimental Low-Cost Prototype:
   The first prototype will be a smaller, cost-effective platform designed for experimentation and learning. This phase will help us study the effects of various design parameters on flight performance, stability.

2. Scaled Functional Prototype(1.5X Model): 
   Based on the insights gained from the initial model, we will develop a second prototypeâ€”scaled up by approximately 1.5 times or more. This larger prototype will be equipped with a functional water spray system, allowing us to simulate real firefighting scenarios and identify practical challenges we may encounter in the final full-scale build.

This two-step iterative process will enable us to refine our design, optimize performance, and develop a reliable and efficient firefighting drone.
Based on learnings of these 2 prototyped we will try to build a final drone to fulfill our objective of 10 - 15 kg payload firefighting drone
